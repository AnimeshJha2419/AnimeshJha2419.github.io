To create this plagiarism detection project for Arabic text files, you would need the following:

1. Programming language: You would need to choose a programming language such as Python or Java to implement the project.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: You would need to install NLP libraries such as NLTK, which provides tools for tokenization, stemming, and stop words removal. You might also need to install additional libraries depending on your project's specific requirements.

3. Data: You would need a dataset of Arabic text files for both training and testing purposes. The dataset should be diverse enough to cover different topics and genres of texts.

4. Vectorization Library: You would need a library for vectorization, such as TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn, which is used to convert text data into numerical vectors.

5. Similarity Metric: You would need to choose a similarity metric such as cosine similarity, which is used to measure the similarity between two vectors.

6. Development Environment: You would need a development environment, such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor, to write and run your code.

7. Storage: You would need storage to store your data and model files.

8. Time and Effort: Developing a plagiarism detection system requires time and effort to create and test the model, tune the parameters, and optimize the performance of the system.
